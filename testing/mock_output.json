prediction, team news, lineups\\nBy Devesh Jaganath | 16h\\nSports Mole previews Friday's Rugby World Cup clash between New Zealand and\\nNamibia, including predictions, team news and possible lineups.\\nThe second week of the 2023 **Rugby World Cup** is here, and in the standalone\\nmatch on Friday evening, we will see **New Zealand** and **Namibia** lock\\nhorns at Stadium de Toulouse.\\nNew Zealand will be looking to bounce back after suffering a huge\\npsychological blow in the opening match of the competition against France,\\nwhile Namibia were taken apart by the Italians the following day.\\n* * *\\n## Match preview\\n© Reuters\\nHistory was made in the first match of the 2023 Rugby World Cup as the All\\nBlacks suffered their first-ever pool-stage defeat at an RWC event, losing\\n27-13 to Les Bleus at Stade de France last week.\\nAfter heading into the break at 9-8, **Ian Foster**'s side were still well in\\nwith a chance and stayed right on the tails of the French up to the hour mark\\nwhen **Will Jordan** was shown a yellow card for a high tackle.\\nFrom there on, Les Bleus piled on the pressure, extending their lead to six\\npoints shortly after Jordan's departure to the sin bin, and they were too\\nstrong for the All Blacks in the closing stages of the match.\\nThat result also marked the New Zealander's second loss in succession,\\nfollowing the defeat South Africa handed them at Twickenham in the warm-up\\nmatches, and is the first time that they have lost back-to-back games in over\\na year.\\nHowever, underestimating the All Blacks is never a good idea, and they will\\ntake that result on the chin and move forward, knowing that they can still go\\non to win the Webb Ellis Cup as the Springboks did in 2019 when they lost\\ntheir opening match to Japan.\\n© Reuters\\nMeanwhile, Namibia suffered a 52-8 defeat by Italy last week, which is the\\ntournament's second-biggest loss so far, with only Romania losing by a bigger\\nmargin in the first week when they were hammered 82-8 by Ireland.\\nAll eight of the Welwitschias points in that match came in the first period,\\nwith **Tiaan Swanepoel**'s penalty in the first five minutes and **Gerswin\\nMouton**'s try mid-way through the half, though they were down 17-8 by the\\nbreak and carried very little threat in the second 40.\\n**Allister Coetzee**'s side had a mixed lead-up to the tournament, which\\nincluded a 26-18 loss against Uruguay at the start of last month, followed by\\na 28-26 win over Chile the next week.\\nNamibia have qualified for each of the last six Rugby World Cups since 1999,\\nbut they have not managed a single win in that time, with their only point at\\nthe RWC coming in a draw against Canada, though that resulted from the match\\nbeing cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis in 2019.\\nThe Welwitschias have faced the All Blacks in each of the last two World Cups\\nand were beaten comprehensively by them on both occasions, which most would\\nexpect will be the likely outcome in this one as well.\\n**New Zealand Rugby World Cup form:**\\n * L\\n**New Zealand form (all competitions):**\\n * W\\n * W\\n * W\\n * W\\n * L\\n * L\\n**Namibia Rugby World Cup form:**\\n * L\\n**Namibia form (all competitions):**\\n * L\\n * W\\n * L\\n * L\\n * W\\n * L\\n \\nAdvert -

The question is, by how many points will they win?\\nA victory for Namibia would go down as possibly the biggest upset in RWC\\nhistory, and we cannot see that happening.

The Chiefs player is a creative talent and\\nelusive runner and the All Blacks look sure to play a wide game and stretch\\nthe underdogs' shaky defence.\\nRather than play the handicap at odds-on, a punt on a winning margin in the\\n60s looks worthwhile. And if McKenzie can prove to be the catalyst for a high-\\nscoring display, he looks a good price at 5-1 for man-of-the-match honours.\\n## Teams\\nNew Zealand: B Barrett; C Clarke, A Lienert-Brown, D Havili, L Fainga’anuku; D\\nMcKenzie, C Roigard; O Tuungafasi; S Taukei’aho, N Laulala, B Retallick, S\\nWhitelock, L Jacobson, D Papali'i, A Savea \\nReplacements: D Coles, E de Groot, F Newell, S Barrett, T Vaa’i, A Smith, R\\nMo’unga, R Ioane\\nNamibia: C Loubser; G Mouton, J Deysel, L R Malan, D Rossouw; T Swanepoel, D\\nStevens; J Benade, T van Jaarsveld, J Coetzee, J Retief, T Uanivi, W Conradie,\\nP Gaoseb, R Hardwick \\nReplacements: L van der Westhuizen, D Sethie, H Shifuka, PJ Van Lill, A\\nBooysen, M Katjijeko, J Theron, JC Greyling\\n* * *\\nSign up to emails from Racing Post Sport and get all the latest news and tips\\nToday's top sports betting stories\\n **Follow us on Twitter** @racingpostsport\\nGraham WoodsRacing Post Sport\\nPublished on 14 September 2023Last updated 15:49, 14 September 2023\\nmore inRugby World Cup\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023: France v Uruguay predictions and best bets\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023: Japan v Chile predictions and betting tips\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023 South Africa v Scotland predictions and rugby union tips\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023: Wales v Fiji predictions and betting tips\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023 Ireland v Romania predictions and rugby union tips: Highflying Ireland asked to set a new record\\nmore inRugby World Cup\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023: France v Uruguay predictions and best bets\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023: Japan v Chile predictions and betting tips\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023 South Africa v Scotland predictions and rugby union tips\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023: Wales v Fiji predictions and betting tips\\n * Rugby World Cup 2023 Ireland v Romania predictions and rugby union tips: Highflying Ireland asked to set a new record\\nFree Bets and Betting\\nFree bets and sign up offersDownload our racing appHow to bet on\\nracingpost.comGuide to racingFree Super TipsMyRacingSoccerbasePickswisePrices\\npowered by Diffusion\\nMembers' Club\\nAbout Members' ClubJoin Members' ClubNewspaperRewards4Racing\\nAbout Us\\nContact us and helpCareersB2B Products & ContentICS-DigitalRacing Post\\nJobsRacing Post ShopTerms, Conditions & PoliciesCommunity, Environment and\\nCorporate ResponsibilityCookie Policy\\nGamble Responsibly\\nDo I have a gambling problem?RaigIbasGamcareGambleawareGamblers Anonymous\\nCopyright © 2023 Spotlight Sports Group Limited or its licensors, all rights\\nreserved\"",

New Zealand took a 13-9 lead with\\na try early in the second half, but the tournament hosts scored the game’s\\nfinal 18 points to deny the All Blacks a losing bonus point.\\nAt this point, winning Pool A is likely beyond the All Blacks at this point\\nunless Italy can defeat France for the first time since 2013.\\nBut they are still considered one of the four leading favorites along with\\nFrance, Ireland, and reigning champions South Africa, who are also vying for a\\nrecord fourth world title.\\n__4.5/5 Review Rating\\nBonus & Benefits \\n50% up to $750 \\nBonus Details »\\n__Best For Prop Betting \\n __Very Fast Payout Times \\n __Sports, Casino, Poker & Racebook\\nBet Now & Claim $750 »\\n## New Zealand vs Namibia Odds\\n**_Odds are via Bovada._**\\n### Spread\\n * New Zealand -72 (+105)\\n * Namibia +72 (-125)\\n### Moneyline\\n * New Zealand -100000\\n * Namibia +6600\\n * Draw +50000\\n### Over/Under\\n * Over 81.5 (-110)\\n * Under 81.5 (-110)\\n## Will New Zealand Pile Up the Tries in Toulouse?\\nMark Telea scored New Zealand’s two tries against France.\\nThe second round of Rugby World Cup pool matches started Thursday with a\\nFrance vs Uruguay match that was far closer than expected.\\nWith 25 minutes left, Uruguay made it a one-point game with a converted try.\\nBut France responded quickly with one of their own and went on to a hard-\\nearned 27-12 win.\\nDon’t expect a similarly close contest in this matchup, however.\\nThis is the third straight World Cup to feature a New Zealand vs Namibia\\nmatchup in pool play. Both previous meetings have been blowouts, and this one\\nshould be as well.\\nIn 2015, the All Blacks defeated Namibia 58-14 in London, with Julian Savea\\nscoring two of his tournament record-equaling eight tries in the match.\\nFour years later, Namibia scored the first points of the game and trailed only\\n10-9 a half hour in.

    "initial_prediction": "- New Zealand has a strong track record in the Rugby World Cup, having won the tournament three times. They are known for their dominant performances and have a history of defeating Namibia convincingly in previous World Cup encounters.\n- Namibia has never won a World Cup match and has suffered heavy defeats in the past, including a 142-0 loss to Australia in 2003. The average losing margin for Namibia is over 60 points.\n- New Zealand has made nine changes to their lineup, which could disrupt their cohesion and rhythm. However, they still have a strong squad with experienced players like Sam Whitelock.\n- Namibia has made six changes to their team, which could also impact their performance.
