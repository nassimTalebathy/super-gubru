The tie is 100/1 with the Uruguay win\\\\nout at 28/1. This is why the spread will garner plenty of attention with\\\\nFrance a 63.5 favourite in the handicap market. No fewer than ten French\\\\nplayers are odds-on to score a try, with Gabin Villiere the and Louis Bielle-\\\\nBiarrey the two shortest prices at 1/5.\\\\n**Team news:**\\\\nBack-rower Anthony Jelonch has battled back from a knee ligament injury\\\\nsuffered in February and has been rewarded with the captaincy, taking the\\\\nhonour for the second time after also leading Les Bleus against Australia in\\\\n2021.\\\\nYoram Moefana, Gabin Villiere and Cameron Woki are the only players retained\\\\nin the run-on side from the win over New Zealand, with Melvyn Jaminet, the\\\\nfinal try-scorer on Friday, coming in at full-back and Maxime Lucu and Antoine\\\\nHastoy paired in the halves.\\\\nFor Uruguay, Etchverry has been selected at number 10 ahead of Felipe Berchesi\\\\nand Arata has been passed fit following a hand injury.\\\\nHe is one of five players who play their rugby in France, while captain Andres\\\\nVilaseca and replacement scrum-half Agustin Ormaechea are set to become the\\\\nfirst Uruguayans to play at three Rugby World Cups.\\\\n**Uruguay +53 @10/11**\\\\nThe decision to take the French team around the country to boost interest and\\\\nbuild momentum looks set to generate a lively atmosphere in Lille.\\\\nUruguay will look to feed off that and are unlikely to take a backward step.\\\\nThey beat Fiji in 2019, ending a 16-year wait for a victory. That result was\\\\nthe culmination of steady improvement, covering significant handicaps in all\\\\nfour matches in 2015 and repeating that against Wales and Australia four years\\\\nago.\\\\nTheir biggest game at this tournament will be against Namibia, whom they beat\\\\n26-18 in August. That fixture takes place in Lyon on September 27 but Los\\\\nTeros will also be determined to show they belong at this level by performing\\\\nin their other matches.\\\\nFrance have the firepower to run riot but their much-changed side may take\\\\ntime to settle, allowing Esteban Meneses' men to get on the board and the\\\\nUruguayans could again come in below the handicap.\\\\n**Anthony Jelonch Anytime Tryscorer @8/11**\\\\nWinger Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Villiere are likely to be well supported in\\\\nthe tryscorer markets, as is back-rower Sekou Macalou, who has the speed and\\\\nball-handling skills of a centre and scored a try in the warm-up win over\\\\nFiji.\\\\nHowever, there is likely to be more value in backing Jelonch to cross. He and\\\\nfellow Toulouse back-rower Francois Cros have battled for the final spot\\\\nalongside Charles Ollivon and Gregory Aldritt in the France team and he will\\\\nbe looking to prove he deserves a place.\\\\nJelonch's magnificent recovery has come as a real boost to Galthie's squad and\\\\na fourth international try appears something to look out for.\\\\n### Share Article\\\\n### Betfred Rugby Union Markets\\\\nRugby Union Odds\\\\nSix Nations Odds\\\\nEnglish Premiership Odds\\\\nRugby Union World Cup Odds\\\\nRugby Union Price Boosts\\\\n### Rugby Union Insights\\\\nSix Nations Tips\\\\nEuropean Champions Cup Tips\\\\nDeposit & bet on sports at a minimum of \\\\u00a310 in one bet transaction at events\\\\n(2.0)+ within 7 days of registering. \\\\u00a330 paid in Free Bets of your first bet\\\\nsettlement, expires 7 days after issue.

France will be looking to keep the\\\\nmomentum they created with their opening night victory over New Zealand. But\\\\nUruguay, who shocked Fiji in 2019, will be looking to hit the ground running.\\\\nSo here are our France v Uruguay predictions.\\\\nLos Teros are making their first appearance of Rugby World Cup 2023 but it is\\\\nalso the first time the action travels to Lille and the Stade Pierre Mauroy.\\\\n_Read more:_Rugby World Cup homepage\\\\n## **France v Uruguay Predictions**\\\\n_Tom Clarke:_ _France by 50 points._ It would be fair to say that if Uruguay\\\\nwere to beat the French hosts it would go down as one of the biggest shocks in\\\\nsports history - the South Americans are 200/1 to win. However they have had\\\\nsome success in recent times, with victories over fellow World Cuppers Namibia\\\\nand Chile in warm-up games. I would suggest that the hosts are likely to win\\\\nby around 50 points - handicap betting seems to suggest something around the\\\\n53 point mark. I would also suggest that the chances of Anthony Jelonch being\\\\ninvolved in a try is very likely, as he returns from injury at No 8.\\\\n_Josh Graham: France by 45 points._ Uruguay brought some feel-good factor in\\\\nJapan four years ago so it's brilliant to welcome them back to the big stage.\\\\nHowever, a much-changed France side will still have far too much firepower for\\\\nthem. If I had to go for a scoreline I'd say France 55-10 Uruguay. So the\\\\nhosts by 45 points is my prediction. Fantasy rugby players and punters, Louis\\\\nBielle-Biarrey is a sure bet to find the tryline on the day he becomes the\\\\nyoungest French player to take the field at a World Cup.\\\\n**Kick Off Time** 8pm BST - 9pm Local \\\\u2013Thursday 14th September\\\\n**TV Channel** ITV1 (UK) - How To Watch The Rugby World Cup\\\\n**Venue** Stade Pierre Mauroy, Lille \\\\n**Capacity:** 50,186 \\\\n**Fun Fact:** Host to two of England's pool games at RWC2023, the World Cup\\\\nstadium in the south of Lille will also be the venue for the handball and\\\\nbasketball tournaments in the Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games.\\\\n**France Form**\\\\nBeat New Zealand \\\\nBeat Australia \\\\nBeat Fiji \\\\nBeat Scotland \\\\nLost to Scotland\\\\n**Uruguay** **Form**\\\\nBeat Namibia \\\\nBeat Chile \\\\nLost to Tonga \\\\nBeat Romania \\\\nLost to Georgia\\\\n**FRANCE V URUGUAY HEAD-TO-HEAD RESULTS**\\\\nFrance and Uruguay have played on two occasions.\\\\nUruguay 6-34 France | 1985\\\\nUruguay 0-61 France | 1985\\\\n## **France v Uruguay Team News**\\\\n_Related:_France Rugby World Cup squad\\\\nThere's an incredible return to the side for Anthony Jelonch as he completes a\\\\nmiraculous comeback to captain the side fewer than seven months after\\\\nsuffering an ACL injury.

They have played five tier-one\\\\nteams in those tournaments and lost all five games by an average margin of 44\\\\npoints.\\\\nThe handicap for this Pool A encounter is 52 points and the South Americans\\\\nmay well have their backers given their strong record. Not only did they stay\\\\nwithin the line in all five of those matches against the big guns in 2015 and\\\\n2019, none of their opponents even scored enough points to reach the handicap.\\\\nThe French side of past tournaments would never be trusted to cover a line of\\\\nmore than 50 points, and in their seven clashes with tier-two teams at the\\\\nlast three World Cups they have rewarded their handicap backers just once when\\\\ngiving up more than 20 points.\\\\nCuriously five of those seven matches ended with a France victory by a\\\\nscoreline of 21 to 30 points, and backing another victory by that margin is a\\\\ntempting 8-1 shot.\\\\nBut this is new-look France who have worked hard to shed their flakey image,\\\\nand underdogs did not fare well against the best teams on the opening weekend,\\\\nwhen Namibia, Romania and Chile all failed to cover and Georgia stayed inside\\\\nthe line by just one point against Australia.\\\\nRather than take even money about a trappy-looking handicap line, backing a\\\\nwin by 41 to 50 points looks more appealing. Uruguay have some experienced\\\\nplayers in their 23 and could hold their own for spells, and while France\\\\nwon't go through the motions, they may not cut loose.\\\\n* * *\\\\n## Click for free bets and betting offers from the Racing Post\\\\n* * *\\\\n **Commercial notice: This article contains affiliate links.

The All Blacks are currently in fourth place in the\\\\npool standings, while the Welwitschias are at the bottom of the group. New\\\\nZealand will be hoping to bounce back from the 27-13 loss they suffered\\\\nagainst France in the opening match of the competition. Having also lost to\\\\nSouth Africa in their final warm-up match, the All Blacks have now lost back-\\\\nto-back matches for the first time in over a year. However, prior to their\\\\nloss against the Springboks, New Zealand were on an 11-match unbeaten run,\\\\nwhich saw them lift the 2023 Rugby Championship title for the third successive\\\\nseason. During that time, they were ranked second in the world but are now in\\\\nfourth place. Still, the All Blacks class is undeniable, and while they have\\\\nsuffered a setback, they are strongly expected to win this match.\\\\nMeanwhile, Namibia suffered the second-highest margin of defeat in the first\\\\nround of matches. They were beaten 52-8 by Italy, with only Romania losing by\\\\na bigger margin of 82-8 against Ireland later the same day. The Namibians had\\\\na mixed warm-up campaign which included a 26-18 loss to Uruguay, followed by a\\\\n28-26 victory over Chile at the start of last month. The Welwitschias are\\\\nranked 21st in the world standings, which is the lowest ranking of any team in\\\\nPool A. They are competing in their sixth consecutive World Cup, though the\\\\nAfrican side have never won a match at the competition. Namibia have faced the\\\\nAll Blacks on two previous occasions at the RWC, which ended in a 58-14 loss\\\\nin 2015 and a 71-9 battering in 2019. It would be one of the greatest-ever\\\\nupsets in the history of Rugby World Cups if the visitors were to win this\\\\none.\\\\nUp to R1000 to bet on New Zealand - Namibia!\\\\nLimited Offer.

It was near enough a \\\\\\\"choice\\\\\\\" game with the\\\\nbookmakers but despite taking the lead early in each half New Zealand were\\\\neventually worn down and they finished beaten 27-13.\\\\nThat was the first ever RWC pool stage defeat for the All Blacks who started\\\\nthe game with a try inside 2 minutes from Telea. They trailed 9-8 at the break\\\\nbut a second try for Telea just after half time put them back in front at 13-9\\\\nbut they failed to add to their tally.\\\\nSkipper Scott Barrett was ruled out of the opening match along with Jordie\\\\nBarrett, Shannon Frizell and Tyrel Lomax, watch the media for news of when\\\\nthey are likely to be available in the remaining pool games.\\\\nNew Zealand had also lost their final warm up match, 35-7 to South Africa at\\\\nTwickenham and that result, coupled with the defeat to the hosts has seen them\\\\ndrift in the outright betting to win the tournament. They are now trading at\\\\naround 4/1 to claim a fourth RWC title with Betway and around 16/1 to finish\\\\ntop of Pool A which is now at the mercy of France.\\\\n## \\\\n## Back the Boks risk-free\\\\nClaim the offer and place a R25 or more outright bet on South Africa to win\\\\nthe Cup by 28 October and get it risk-free up to R1,000.
